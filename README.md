## BT305: Ribosome Installation and Usage Guide

### 1. Download the Ribosome Folder
 Download the entire Ribosome folder to your local machine.

### 2. Compile the Source Code
 Navigate to the `src` directory within the Ribosome folder using the terminal. Then, compile the code by running the following command:

    f77 -O *.f -o ribosome

This command compiles all Fortran (`.f`) files in the `src` directory and generates an executable named `ribosome`.

### 3. Prepare the Working Directory
Copy the compiled `ribosome` executable and the `res.zmat` file from the `src` directory to your working directory. 
The working directory is where you will be running the Ribosome program.

    cp ribosome res.zmat /path/to/your/working/directory

## How to Run Ribosome

### 1. Execute the Program
In your working directory, run the Ribosome program with the following command:

    ./ribosome input.rib output.rib res.zmat

 - `input.rib` is the input file containing the necessary data for Ribosome to process.
 - `output.rib` is the file where the output will be saved.
 - `res.zmat` is the required file that contains specific parameters needed by Ribosome.

### 2. Review Output
 After execution, check the `output.rib` file for the results generated by Ribosome.
